# TODO

* Write a program that uses a recusive algorithm that calculates 25! (factorial).
* Fibonacci sequence - get the test running and re-implement using an iterative rather than recurisve approach. What are the pros and cons of each?
* Get the binary tree test to pass. Use recursion to solve the problems.
* Use Nokogiri to obtain the HTML DOM for the NASDAQ: http://finance.yahoo.com/actives?e=o
* Convert the relevant part of the page into a binary tree, using the stock price and stock name as the data
* Write a search function that returns the stocks in order of price
* Get the Dijkstras test to pass. Add an algorithm that calculates the shortest distances between any two nodes.
